                  <p><strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong><br>
                    <strong>1. AUTO DEALER WEBSITE</strong> gathers and uses certain information about individuals in line with the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) to provide a professional service to our customers and to notify customers of future auctions and sales. By registering as a Purchaser, you grant <strong>AUTO DEALER WEBSITE</strong> permission in terms of the POPI Act to use your personal information for the above. For our full privacy policy <strong>KEEP READING.</strong><br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>2.</strong> The purchaser regards these terms and conditions as binding on he/she/its executors, Legatees, Heirs, Successors in title and or assigned respectively, as specified during the announcements irrespective of whether he/she/it is present at the time such announcements are made. Special terms and conditions relating to each auction and/or to any of the lots may be announced prior to the commencement of the auction and/or during the auction.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>3.</strong> The purchaser will adhere to all relevant <strong>FICA</strong> requirements on auction.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>4.</strong> A refundable deposit is payable to receive a registration card, purchaser&rsquo;s number and to bid on the auction. However, should the purchaser fail to pay his account after conclusion of the auction, subject to clause 12 below, the deposit will be retained by the auctioneer.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>5.</strong> No person will be allowed to bid on the auction, unless he/she has obtained his/her own registration card and number.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>6.</strong> Every bid shall constitute an offer to purchase for the amount bid. No bids can be withdrawn by the purchaser.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>7.</strong> The highest bidder accepted by the auctioneer shall be the purchaser if NO RESERVE or SUBJECT TO CONFIRMATION is applicable.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>8. All sales are done in one of the following manners:</strong><br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>8.1 NO RESERVE</strong> - means that there is no established minimum price for the item being auctioned. This means that no matter what the winning bid, the owner must sell it for that amount; or<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>8.2 RESERVE</strong> - means a minimum price that must be attained for the bid to be accepted. In compliance with the National Consumer Protection Act and the Regulations thereto, Vendor Bidding is permitted at the auction, and the seller, auctioneer or a Vendor Bidder representing the seller or the auctioneer may bid up to an amount and not exceeding the Reserve price. If no bid equals or exceeds the reserve price, the property may be withdrawn from the auction.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>8.3 SUBJECT TO CONFIRMATION</strong> - means that the owner must accept or reject the bid after finalisation of the auction. The Seller has 2 (two) business days (&ldquo;the Confirmation Period&rdquo;) to accept or reject the offer.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>9.</strong> No bid may be withdrawn after the fall of the hammer until the expiry of the Confirmation Period. During this time the offer shall be open for acceptance by the Seller or his agent and if the offer is accepted, the sale shall be deemed to be a sale by auction for purposes of the Act.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>10.</strong> Higher offers may be made prior to confirmation or registration of transfer (whichever occurs first). Such higher offers must be made to the auctioneer on the same terms and conditions as the offer on the auction, but the original bidder at the auction shall have the right to equal such offers which offer will be preferent to any other offers.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>11.</strong> The purchaser from the auction must exercise this right within 24 hours (excluding public holidays and weekends) after being so notified by the auctioneer, by submitting and equivalent offer and supplementing his deposit accordingly.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>12.</strong> No &ldquo;ringing&rdquo; shall be permitted and if the auctioneer suspect that the bidders are involved in such activity, he shall be entitled to suspend or terminate the auction or to prohibit those bidders suspected of such activity from making any further bids. In this context ringing are defined as a group of purchasers at an auction who collude not to bid against one another to keep the auction price low.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>13.</strong> The auctioneer is entitled to correct any bona fide error in the conduct or conclusion of any sale or arising from any incorrect information to the items for sale. If the error is not capable of being corrected, then the auction shall be deemed not having taken place and no party at the auction will have any claims against the auctioneer or the seller arising from the cancellation of the auction.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>14.</strong> These Rules of Auction comply with the provisions of Section 45 of the Consumer Protection Act, 68 of 2008. Sub sections (1), (2) and (3) of this Section provides as follows:<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>(1)</strong> In this section, &ldquo;auction&rdquo; includes a sale in execution of or pursuant to a court order, to the extent that the order contemplates that the sale is to be conducted by an auction.<br />

                    <strong>(2)</strong> When good are put up for sale by auction in lots, each lot is, unless there is evidence to be contrary regarded to be the subject of a separate transaction.<br />

                    <strong>15. All items are sold &ldquo;voetstoots&rdquo;.</strong><br />

                    <strong>16.</strong> No representations or warranties are made by the auctioneer or the seller.

                    <br />
                    <strong>19.</strong> The auctioneer shall have the right to control, regulate and record the auction. The recording of the auction shall be prima facie evidence of the auction proceedings.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>20.</strong> The auctioneer may accept or reject bids in his sole discretion without providing reasons. This would include rejecting an offer previously accepted by the auctioneer. In the event of a dispute between bidders, the auctioneer will have the discretion to put the property (movable/immovable) up for auction again and his decision shall be final and binding. The auctioneer may, without penalty or prior notice, withdraw any item(s) from any group of assets (&ldquo;lots&rdquo;) on auction at any time before the sale thereof or during the auction.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>21.</strong> The auctioneer&rsquo;s vendor roll is final and binding and will be recorded for quality purposes and as prima facia proof on all bids accepted and should the Purchaser dispute any item on said roll, the onus of proof, is on the Purchaser.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>22.</strong> All accounts must be paid in full during or directly after the auction.<br />
